# [Cratylus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cratylus_(dialogue))

This repository exists so I can compare features of different stacks, languages and frameworks.

## Functionality

I'm this will be revised, but a starting point:

* web front end
* serverside back end (regular request/response)
* database
* CRUD
* authn/authz
* long running job
  * workers
  * progress communication to the client (websocket)
* some external API interaction
* caching layer
* CDN for static content
* not only json format...
* tests
* infrastructure management
* CI/CD

## Motivation

To provide focus for implementation of functionality, I'll implement a nutrition analysis 
tool where a user can record meals and generate reports. The projects are over-engineered 
in some ways and not production ready in others.
